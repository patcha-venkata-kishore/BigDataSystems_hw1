Dogs vs Cats 
Code is largly copy from blog "Building powerful image classification models using very little data"
I added few lines of code to generate reports of loss and accuracy per Epoc. 

Please run on python 3.x with Keras and matplotlib. 
run main.py with kensar flow environment. 
Two plots will be generated. 

Data folder structure is in a format that Keras ImageDataGenerator can generate vectors with image RBG. 
Once we have data we are ready for creating model, compiling and training. 

Note that there are two main.py files. One file for problem1.1 and other is for problem1.2. 
Please get whole code to a project and then run main files.
